# Superstack - Webmardi Demo

This repo contains the demo code from [our talk at webmardi on May 7, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/live/ItuOC-SBwt4?feature=shared) when we first introduced our boilerplate [superstack](https://github.com/superhuit-agency/superstack).

Clone this repo and follow the setup guide in https://github.com/superhuit-agency/superstack.

Then follow [this step by step guide](./docs/create-block-step-by-step.md) to create a block like we did during the Webmardi demo, or watch the talk: https://www.youtube.com/live/ItuOC-SBwt4?feature=shared.
